# My Neovim Config
The purpose of this repo is to be able to share and sync my config across multiple devices.

The config is a modified version of [kickstarter](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that I continue to update over time. If you are new to neovim or vim, I recommend you start there.
